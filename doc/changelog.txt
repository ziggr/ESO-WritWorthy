[*] Support Arkadius' Trade Tools. Untested. Thank you, Patros, for the code.

[*] Fix: Pyandonean motifs fixed.
[*] New: "Unknown motif: 73" error tooltip for motifs such as Welkynar that appear in writs but whose crafting details are not yet in-game and programmed into WritWorthy. Also omit such writs from WritWorthy autocraft window: they are not yet worthy.
[/LIST]

[B]4.0.10 2018-06-01[/B]

[/LIST]

[B]4.0.2 2018-04-20[/B]

[*] New option: showing price in tooltip is now optional. Because some people use WritWorthy more for the crafting and less for the pricing. Thank you @Jerkling for the feature request.
[*] New option: Include bank when listing writs available to craft. Be careful with this: no warning if you craft the same banked writ on multiple characters. Thank you @UESP for the feature request.

[*] Update to LibLazyCrafting 1.5. Same library version as in Dolgubon's Lazy Writ Crafter v36.8 and Dolgubon's Lazy Set Crafter v1.0.19
[*] Allow WritWorthy window to be moved partially offscreen. Zig finds it [i]very[/i] handy to slide the window off to the right and just focus on crafting station names when doing dozens of master writs at a time.
[*] Stop making an unnecessary extra crafted provisioning/alchemy item. Thank you Dolgubon for finding a 100% reproduction case.
[/LIST]

[B]3.2.1 2017-10-29[/B]

[LIST]
[*]"Show material list in chat" has a new "Alchemy only" option for folks (like me!) who only check the material list for alchemy.

[*]LibLazyCrafting: update from version 0.4 to 1.2, adapt to some API changes
[*]LibLazyCrafting: fix bugs/missing features in 1.2, bump version to 1.3. This is not an official Dolgubon library release, so I expect bugs/surprises next time Dolgubon updates any of their crafting add-ons.

[B]3.1.3 2017-08-15[/B]

[B]3.1.2 2017-08-14[/B]
[LIST]
[*]"Motif X not known" fixed. I was off by +1 for all motifs.
[*]HotR Motifs added: Redoran, Hlaalu, Telvanni. Not sure if they'll show up in writs, but if they do, WritWorthy will now check Master Merchant for their style material prices, just likt it does for all other motifs.
[/LIST]

[B]3.1.1 2017-08-14[/B]

[*]ESO 3.1 Horns of the Reach/API 20
[*]Squelch errors for "table index is nil" for new item style constants.
[*]Autocraft: no longer add mystery +1 to motif index. No longer required or correct.
[*]KNOWN BUG: "Motif Barbaric not known" even though you do know this motif. For some reason the ESO API returns "false" for IsSmithingStyleKnown(barbaric=17+1) even if you know that motif. All motifs off by one.
[/LIST]

[B]3.0.7 2017-07-16[/B]

[*]Public API Support: new function WritWorthy.ToMatCost(itemLink) returns material cost for a single writ.

[B]3.0.5 2017-06-22[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Replace hardcoded skill indices with a runtime scan for localized skill name. Turns out those indices change from player to player, are not constants. And there are no "skillId" analogs to "itemId" constants. Oh well. Fall back to string matching. Hopefully this will end the many reports of nil errors on other people's ESO clients. I included the names for EN, DE, and FR.  I do not have a JP client, so I lack those names, sorry.

[B]3.0.1 2017-05-21[/B]

[*] ESO 3.0 Morrowind/API 19
[*] Temporary workaround: some item style constants changed in the new API and until I can figure out the new ones, use magic numbers. WritWorthy might report incorrect known/unknown results for these three motifs: Skinchanger, Grim Harlequin, Hollowjack.
[*] Provisioning: require 2x crafting attempts, since most Provisioning writs seem to require 8 servings. (I assume any character performing master writs will have Chef/Brewer/Chemistry passive skills maxxed out.)

[LIST]
[*]Debug log: records details about the 20 most recent writs. If there's a problem with a writ, send a screenshot of the offending writ (or the UI error), and a screenshot of the writ that caused the problem. This ought to help me figure out what's going wrong.

[*]Stop crashing auf Deutsch. When building recipe ingredient lists out of ZOS-returned data, use item links, not names, as element keys. All WritWorthy text is still in US English. The only change here is that it can run correctly when the ESO client is set to German.
