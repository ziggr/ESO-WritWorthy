From HarvestMap: a ton of libraries. Which do I really need?

Lib3D by Shinni
    http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1664-Lib3D.html
    LibGPS2 required
    LibMapPing required
    Seems to handle scale factors for maps, coord/meter conversion
    Lacks scale info for player housing, but probably could be added easily.
    "HousingWorld" vs. "PersistenWorld or just 'World'"
    Origin is NW corner with increasing values of X,Z going East, South

LibGPS by Sirinsidiator, votan
    aka LibGPS2
    LibMapPing required
    maps and waypoints and map clicks
    local/zone/global X,Y conversions

Not sure we HAVE to use any of this if we're in HousingWorld, where coordinates are in centimeters and the origin never changes out from under us as the player moves about (unlike in the full world, where the origin resets to player position every 1km)

HarvestMap/InRangePins.lua
    is where the worldMarker.dds texture is loaded

function InRangePins:GetNewWorldControl(
      pinTypeId
    , globalX
    , globalY
    , worldZ
    , version
    )

    pin / beam / icon

    beam:Create3DRenderSpace()
    beam:Set3DRenderSpaceOrigin(x,y,z)
    beam:Set3DLocalDimensions(width,height)
